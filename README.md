# Editor for Tangram scene files

Tangram Play is an editor for Mapzen's [Tangram map-rendering library](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram) that makes it easy to build or modify Tangram scene files and see your changes right away. It runs entirely in your browser and can be accessed at https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/.
